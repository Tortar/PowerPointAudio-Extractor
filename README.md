# PowerPointAudio-Extractor

Are you tired to listen to powerpoint audios at normal speed or to extract audio files from it manually ? Use this script ! 

For each powerpoint in the same folder of the script , it extracts and joins audio files in a single file .wav: you can easily speed up the audio from here. 

Don't worry about moving on with the slides: a cute bell sound will warn you ! (you can change the new_slide.wav sound if you don't like it, you just have to mantain the same name for the new file)

# Setup 

First, if you don't have it, [download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install python3 (remember to check the 'add python to PATH' tickbox during the installation). 

Make sure to follow the steps to [configure pydub for your operating system](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub#getting-ffmpeg-set-up).

Lastly, you need to put your powerpoints(.pptx) inside the py_extractor folder. That's it!
